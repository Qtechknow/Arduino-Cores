What is a Quasi-duino?

Quasi-duino is Italian for Almost-duino.  The $9 Quasi-duino is an open source minimal components Arduino.  All it has on the mini breadboard are wires, a reset button, and an ATmega328p.  This takes off the USB interface, ISP header, and the crystal so that your Quasi-duino fits into your projects.  This uses the 8MHz internal clock.  You might say, "Why does the Arduino have an external crystal when it can use its internal clock?"  The answer is that the Arduino can run without the internal clock, but it is less accurate.  The only time when you would absolutely need an external clock is in consumer electronics products, high voltage projects (I would not recommend using high power), or in serial communication.  You program this by using ArduinoISP, and the attached Quasi-duino core for Arduino.
